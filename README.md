# Gender Classification in CMC using Machine Learning

This repository contains the source code and scripts used in the dissertation project titled "Rediscovering Gendered Linguistic Patterns in Early Computer-Mediated Communication: A Machine Learning Analysis of The Leeds List."

## Overview

This project explores gender differences in communication styles using machine learning techniques applied to email data from The Leeds List, a mailing list from the 1990s. The study uses Random Forest (RF) and BERT models to classify gender based on linguistic features extracted from the text data.
